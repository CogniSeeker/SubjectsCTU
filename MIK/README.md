# MIK (Microcontrollers)
This course is centered on low-level C programming for microcontrollers. The assignments are focused on setting appropriate bits, working with registers, servicing time interrupt flags, and interacting with alphanumeric LCDs. Additional topics include using AD converters, implementing the I2C protocol, and generating PWM signals.

## Assignment 01
Setting Ports for Controlling LEDs

## Assignment 01b
Setting Ports for Reading Button States and Controlling LEDs

## Assignment 02
Set up and test communication between the microcontroller and an alphanumeric display. The display is connected to the microcontroller via an 8-bit data bus (Port D) and a 2-bit control bus (Port E).

1. Experiment with different settings of the LCD controller (changing the cursor shift direction, scrolling text on the LCD, changing the cursor position on the display â€“ writing on the second line).
2. Try creating your own character.

## Assignment 03
1. Setting up Port D
2. Setting up Timer0
3. Setting up Timer0 interrupts
## Assignment 04
1. Setting up ports
2. Setting up the AD converter
3. Voltmeter
## Assignment 05
Write and read a byte from EEPROM memory connected to the microcontroller via the I2C bus.

## Assignment 06
Set up the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) module for sending and receiving data from the serial terminal.

## Assignment 07
Set up the CCP1 module to generate a 10kHz PWM signal.
