# Running Reversi Game with GUI

You can run the interactive version of the game against my player with:

```bash
python3 reversi_creator.py player
```

Then in a GUI choose one of players to be "player", and another one to be "interactive".

Have a fun!

P.S., you can specify your player as well to play against mine:

```bash
python3 reversi_creator.py player another_player yet_another_player
```
