# KUI (Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence)
This course covers essential AI concepts and their practical applications. Topics include the A* algorithm for maze-solving, a Reversi player using the Minimax algorithm, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning with policy updates, and classification techniques such as K-NN and Naive Bayes Classification.

## A* algorithm
A simple implementation of the A* algorithm for maze-solving.

## Reversi Game
The main file, player.py, contains a player for the board game Reversi, implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. You can use an interactive GUI to try it out.

## Reinforcement learning
A function is included for generating a policy for a maze using reinforcement learning.

## Markov Decision Process
Two functions are provided for creating a Markov Decision Policy for a maze: one using value iteration and the other using policy iteration.

## Symbol recognition
A k-NN and Naive Bayes classifiers were implemented to recognize a handwritten letter/number based on the training data.
