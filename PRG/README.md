# PRG (Programming in C)
This course focuses on fundamental C programming concepts, such as implementing various data structures, managing memory with the heap, and using pointers. You will also find projects involving file I/O operations, C standard library functions, and more advanced topics. The semestral project is a multi-threaded fractal drawing program (which is featured in a different repository).

## 01 Drawing a house using ASCII
This program draws a house using ASCII symbols based on inputs for house height, width, fence length, and fence height. It practices nested loops, decomposing a program into functions, applying conditions, and error handling.

## 02 Prime number decomposer
The program reads a list of positive integers from standard input, ending with zero, and performs their prime factorization. The sieve of Eratosthenes is used to improve time efficiency.

## 03 Caeser cipher
The task is to decrypt a message encoded with the Caesar cipher, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of places. The program tests all possible shifts to find the best match against a partially known original text. It practices dynamic memory allocation based on input size.

## 04 Caseser cipher with Wagner-Fisher algorithm
This extends the previous task to handle complete letter loss or addition, with varying input lengths. It uses the Wagner-Fischer algorithm to compute Levenshtein distance and determine the most likely text. This task focuses on dynamic memory allocation and testing with inputs of different lengths.

## 05 Matrix calculator
Without using the <string.h> library, write a program to read lines from a file containing a specified string, implementing a simplified version of the Unix grep command. Additional features include standard input redirection, regular expressions, and colored output.

## 06 Circular queue
Implement a circular queue in an array where elements do not shift during pop() operations. The array is conceptually circular, and pointers move to indicate the start and end of the data region. Special attention is required when elements wrap around to the beginning of the array.

## 07 Linked list queue
Implement a queue using a linked list to store integers. The queue should support operations like push() to add elements, pop() to remove elements, insert() to insert elements in order, erase() to delete specific elements, getEntry() to get the value at a specific position, size() to return the current number of elements, and clear() to remove all elements.

## Testing
1. **Create a Directory**: Set up a directory for your homework assignments.
2. **Organize Testing Files**: Place the provided testing files into a designated folder (default: testing_files as specified in the Makefile).
3. **Download the Makefile**: Download the Makefile from the homework folder you wish to test.

### Commands for Makefile:

- `all`: Compiles main.c.
- `test_random`: Runs tests using random input generated by generate_solutions.sh.
- `test_data`: Runs tests using predefined input from the data folder.
- `valgrind_data, valgrind_random`: Checks for errors and memory leaks with Valgrind using two different sets of input data.
- `zip`: Creates a zip archive containing main.c.
