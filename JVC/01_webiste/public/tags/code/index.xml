      <description>Wireless Servo control using ESP32 and ESP8266&#xA;Wireless Servo control using ESP-NOW ESP32 and ESP8266 Idea I hope you enjoyed my previous project in Week 7, because this project is based on it. For the semestral project called Robotic arm control inteface I would like to transfer an Encoder position to the position of Servo, and of course it would be cool and convenient to do it wirelessly!&#xA;I came across a short video about the ESP-NOW protocol, I got interested and found out that it was a great way to connect two ESP boards.</description>

      <description>Testing max load of two Servomotors SG90 and their responce to an encoder&#xA;Servomotors max load and responce Idea As you can see in my Week 1 post, the semestral project is to create a Robotic arm control inteface. For this purpose we will need to use encoders which would transfer information to our motors copying the movements of the human arm. There was a mechanical rotary encoder Keyes KY-040 in our kit, so I decided to take it for testing, altough we will need to use something more advanced later like a magnetic rotary encoder.</description>

      <description>Creating Atari Breakout game on oled and lcd dispays&#xA;Atari Breakout game Inspiration I missed coding in C++, so this time I wanted to create a project where I would code a lot. A game is a great example. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a linear potenciometer in our JVC kits that can be used as an input for something. And I was hit by the idea: to replicate the old legendary classic - Atari Breakout game.</description>
