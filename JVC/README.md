# JVC (How to make (almost) anything)

In this course, we will take an exciting journey through various engineering domains, including laser cutting, 3D printing and scanning, electronics assembly, Arduino projects, CNC milling, and more. One of the tasks in this project is to create a personal website to document our progress and results.

Detailed documentation of all projects can be found on my [personal webiste](https://b232_b3b35jvc.pages.fel.cvut.cz/borysole).


## List of projects:

### 2D laser cutting
A palm tree from polygons cut from a 2.4 mm cardboard using laser cutting.

### 3D printing and scanning
A watch stand 3D printed from PLA and a chess queen scanned using a 3D scanner. 

### Kinetic sculpture 
A wooden production line powered by Geneva linear mechanism, created in Fusion 360 and cut using laser cutting.

### Electronics assembly
A simple soldered led blinker.

### Atari Breakout game 
An Atari Breakout game on OLED and LCD dispays with a paddle controlled by a slide potentiometer. 

### Load lifting by a servo with encoder
A program for a servo motor SG90 controlled by an encoder to test the maximum weight load.

### An American Saloon sign
An American Saloon sign based on a meme and milled on a CNC machine.

### Moulding and casting
Moulding and casting a small figure and a circuit board.

### Team CNC project
CNC machine that draws pictures using long exposition.
