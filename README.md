# CTU FEL CyR (Cybernetics and Robotics) projects
Here I publish my projects from different subjects at Czech Technical University. Each folder corresponds to a different subject I've studied and focuses on a specific topic. Feel free to browse, use, and contribute.

**Disclaimer:** If you are a student at CTU, here is a friendly warning: these notes and code snippets are great for learning, but should be handled carefully. Copying can lead to serious academic consequences. Use responsibly and keep your grades safe. Youâ€™ve been warned.

## ALP (Algorithms and Programming)
This course focused on implementing various algorithms and programming challenges using Python. The projects include working with sequences, RSA encryption, BFS algorithms, finding the closest point and circumference, solutions for Tic-Tac-Toe strategies, and Ubongo figure placements. You will also find an implemented player for a TRAX game as the semestral project.

## JVC (How to make (almost) anything)

In this course, we will explore various engineering domains, including laser cutting, 3D printing and scanning, electronics assembly, Arduino projects, CNC milling, and more. One of the tasks in this project is to create a personal website to document our progress and results.

Detailed documentation of all projects can be found on my [personal website](https://b232_b3b35jvc.pages.fel.cvut.cz/borysole).

## KUI (Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence)
This course covers essential AI concepts and their practical applications. Topics include the A* algorithm for maze-solving, a Reversi player using the Minimax algorithm, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning with policy updates, and classification techniques such as K-NN and Naive Bayes Classification.

## MIK (Microcontrollers)
This course is centered on low-level C programming for microcontrollers. You will find projects focused on setting appropriate bits, working with registers, servicing time interrupt flags, and interacting with alphanumeric LCDs. Additional topics include using AD converters, implementing the I2C protocol, and generating PWM signals.

## PRG (Programming in C)
This course focuses on fundamental C programming concepts, such as implementing various data structures, managing memory with the heap, and using pointers. You will also find projects involving file I/O operations, C standard library functions, and more advanced topics. The semestral project is a multi-threaded fractal drawing program (which is featured in a different repository).
